## Problem

- I have a static site
- I want to add a newsletter subscription
  - I want to collect email addresses
  - Verify the subscription by sending an email
- I want to later send updates to the subscribers
  - Some updates might be manual
  - Some updates might be automated (What does automated updates even mean?!!)
- Let's assume update format is markdown? or no?
- Maybe use https://maily.to/ editor?

## Attempt 1

Let's assume once we get list of all subscribers, sending email is a different problem (Maybe we can use https://resend.com/broadcasts). The challenge for now is how to collect the email address.

Resend has documented how to maintain audience: https://resend.com/docs/knowledge-base/audience-hygiene
