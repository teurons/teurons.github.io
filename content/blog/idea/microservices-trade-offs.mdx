# Microservices Trade-offs

Microservices architecture has become the default choice for many organizations building cloud-native applications. However, this architectural style comes with significant trade-offs that teams should carefully consider before adoption.

## The Promise of Microservices

Microservices offer several compelling benefits:

### Independent Deployment

Teams can release services independently, accelerating delivery cycles and reducing coordination overhead.

### Technology Diversity

Different services can use different languages and frameworks, allowing teams to select the best tool for each specific domain.

## Hidden Costs

Despite these advantages, microservices introduce substantial complexity:

### Distributed Systems Challenges

Microservices turn previously simple function calls into network requests, bringing all the challenges of distributed systems:

- Network latency
- Partial failures
- Eventual consistency
- Debugging complexity

### Operational Overhead

The operational burden grows significantly with microservices:

1. Complex deployment pipelines
2. Service discovery mechanisms
3. Monitoring and observability tools
4. Distributed tracing
