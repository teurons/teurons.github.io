# Ethical AI Development

As artificial intelligence becomes embedded in critical systems across society, developers face increasing responsibility to create systems that operate ethically and avoid harm.

## Key Ethical Considerations

Several principles should guide responsible AI development:

### Fairness and Bias

AI systems must be evaluated for bias in both data and algorithms:

```python
# Example: Basic bias detection in embeddings
def detect_embedding_bias(embeddings, protected_groups):
    bias_scores = {}
    for group in protected_groups:
        group_vectors = embeddings[group['members']]
        reference_vectors = embeddings[group['reference']]

        similarity = cosine_similarity(group_vectors, reference_vectors)
        bias_scores[group['name']] = similarity.mean()

    return bias_scores
```

### Transparency and Explainability

Complex AI systems should be designed with explainability in mind, particularly for high-stakes applications like healthcare and criminal justice.

## Operationalizing Ethics

Moving from principles to practice requires concrete approaches:

### Ethics by Design

Ethical considerations must be integrated throughout the development lifecycle, not added as an afterthought.

### Diverse Teams

Development teams should include diverse perspectives to identify potential harms that might otherwise be overlooked.
