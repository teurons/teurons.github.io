## Problem

Fuma Docs is a tool to add documentation using MDX in NextJS. I loved the UX/UI it gave out of the box, particularly the table of contents.

It doesn't support "blog" out of the box, and since it's a framework which also provides parsing for MDX files, I used it to build my blog.

I made multiple attempts at it, and this article is about the trials and tribulations of implementing category functionality on Fuma Docs.

## Attempt 1: Using Frontmatter

I added `category` to frontmatter like the following:

```md
---
title: Open Source Sustainability
description: Exploring the challenges and solutions for maintaining healthy open source ecosystems
author: rajiv
date: 2025-03-12
category: tech
---
```

I extended the frontmatter in `source.config.ts` to support `category`.

```ts
export const blog = defineCollections({
  type: "doc",
  dir: "content/blog",
  schema: frontmatterSchema.extend({
    category: z.string(),
  }),
});
```

I then added a route `app/(home)/blog/[category]/[slug]/page.tsx` and needed to generate these URLs as static params.

```tsx
export function generateStaticParams(): { category: string; slug: string }[] {
  return blogSource.getPages().map((page) => ({
    category: page.data.category,
    slug: page.slugs[0] || "",
  }));
}
```

And finally:

```tsx
export default async function Page(props: {
  params: Promise<{ category: string; slug: string }>;
}) {
  const params = await props.params;
  const page = getPostsByCategoryAndSlug(params.category, params.slug);
  // Rest of the code
}
```

## Attempt 2: Using Folders

In fact, this is how Fuma Docs implements documentation out of the box. You can create folders of any depth - but all I needed was 2 levels.

Realizing that I could just use folders was a face-palm moment, because the above attempt was the definition of overkill - I didn't spend enough time to understand how Docs handles this!

So, now it's as simple as:

```tsx
export default async function Page(props: {
  params: Promise<{ slug?: string[] }>;
}) {
  const params = await props.params;
  const page = blogSource.getPage(params.slug);
  // Rest of the code
}

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return blogSource.generateParams();
}
```
